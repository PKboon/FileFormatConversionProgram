# FileFormatConversionProgram
This project involves designing and creating a C++ program which will be used to convert a “pipe-delimited” text file to a file in CSV format. (The vertical bar character, “|”, is often called a “pipe” character. So a text file with vertical bar delimiters is often called a “pipe-delimited” file). (Microsoft Visual Studio)
